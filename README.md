# Project-1
This project aims to explore the correlation between various factors that that affect the happinness or the well-being of citizens in just over 150 countries.
The information in our data spans from the years 2015 to 2019.
The various values assigned to the variables were the average values of various questions asked to some citizens of each country. These questions cover a number of issues
ranging from views on the economy, public perceptions of corruption, and social issues such as freedom to make life choices and support from family and friends.

In our exploratory analyses we ask the main questions:

First Question: 
Over the course of the 5 years, was there a relationship between a country's GDP per capita and the generosity of its citizens?

Second Question:
How did the average happiness of the 5 happiest countries and 5 least happiest countries change over the years?

Third Question:
What attributes affect the happiness of citizens the most? 

We formulated a hypothesis and plotted various relations in order to understand the data better and to be able to answer these questions.

The data was obtained from kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/stpeteishii/world-happiness-ranking-slide-show
